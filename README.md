# Spotty Triggers

Trigger keywords for [Spotty](https://github.com/spotty/spotty), the Raycast-style
launcher for GNOME. Install any trigger from the Triggers window in Spotty
(Settings → Triggers → Browse Triggers), or import a manifest file manually.

## Repository layout

```
index.json            ← browse listing (shown in the marketplace)
triggers/<id>.json      ← one manifest per trigger
```

Spotty fetches `index.json` for the list and `triggers/<id>.json` on install.
The default repository URL is:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<your-user>/spotty-triggers/main
```

You can also point the marketplace at a local copy for testing:

```
file:///home/you/spotty-triggers
```

## Authoring a trigger

A manifest is a JSON file with three action types:

### `web` — open a URL with the query

```json
{
  "id": "dictionary",
  "name": "Dictionary",
  "word": "dict",
  "description": "Look up a word definition",
  "icon": "accessories-dictionary-symbolic",
  "shortcut": "",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "you",
  "action": {
    "type": "web",
    "url": "https://www.dictionary.com/browse/{query}"
  }
}
```

Type `dict word` in Spotty → the URL opens with `word` substituted
(URL-encoded). `icon` is a symbolic icon name from the GNOME/Adwaita icon
theme (test with `gtk4-icon-browser`, or pick from
`/usr/share/icons/Adwaita/symbolic/`); leave it empty for a default.

### `files` — search files by extension

```json
{
  "id": "books",
  "name": "Books",
  "word": "book",
  "description": "Find your e-books",
  "icon": "x-office-document-symbolic",
  "shortcut": "",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "you",
  "action": {
    "type": "files",
    "extensions": ["epub", "pdf", "mobi"]
  }
}
```

An empty `extensions` list means "all files" (like the built-in `find`).

### `shell` — run a command with the query

```json
{
  "id": "download",
  "name": "Download with yt-dlp",
  "word": "dl",
  "description": "Download a video",
  "icon": "folder-download-symbolic",
  "shortcut": "",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "you",
  "action": {
    "type": "shell",
    "command": "yt-dlp -o '~/Videos/%(title)s.%(ext)s' {query}"
  }
}
```

**Security:** `{query}` is single-quote-escaped by Spotty — user input can
never inject extra shell commands, only the command template you write runs.
Do NOT wrap `{query}` in your own quotes. Because shell triggers run commands
as the user, Spotty shows the exact command and asks for confirmation at
install time. Users should only install shell triggers they trust.

### `help` and `help_image` (optional)

`help` is usage text shown in the preview panel when the trigger is selected
in the `triggers` search; when omitted, Spotty generates instructions from the
action type. `help_image` is an optional URL of a screenshot rendered below
the text (downloaded once and cached):

```json
{
  "id": "dictionary",
  "name": "Dictionary",
  "word": "dict",
  "description": "Look up a word definition",
  "icon": "accessories-dictionary-symbolic",
  "shortcut": "",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "you",
  "help": "Type \"dict <word>\" to look up a definition.",
  "help_image": "https://example.com/screenshots/dict.png",
  "action": {
    "type": "web",
    "url": "https://www.dictionary.com/browse/{query}"
  }
}
```

### `shortcut`

Optional GNOME-style global shortcut (e.g. `"Super+Ctrl+D"`) that opens
Spotty directly in the trigger's mode. Registered on install, removed on
uninstall.

### Rules

- `id` must be unique, lowercase, and use only letters, digits, `_`, `-`, `.`
- `word` is the trigger text — it must not collide with a built-in trigger
  (`find`, `clip`, `app`, `cmd`, `emoji`) or another trigger
- keep `name` short; `summary` (index only) shows under the name in the
  marketplace
